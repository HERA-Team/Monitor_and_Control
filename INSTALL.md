HERA M&C Installation
=====================

Installation of the Python code is just done with a standard

```
python setup.py install
```

Database setup
--------------

We run PostgreSQL in production and, while SQLAlchemy abstracts between
different database backends as best it can, it is very desirable that you run
PostgreSQL in your test environment as well. Use Google to learn how to do
this, or follow the OS-X-specific notes below.

After setting up the database, you need to fill in the configuration file
`~/.hera_mc/mc_config.json`, which tells the M&C system how to talk to the
database. An example file is:

```
{
  "default_db_name": "hera_mc",
  "databases": {
    "hera_mc": {
      "url": "postgresql://hera@localhost/hera_mc",
      "mode": "production"
    },
    "testing": {
      "url": "postgresql://hera@localhost/hera_mc_test",
      "mode": "testing"
    }
  }
}
```

This example assumes that youâ€™re running PostgreSQL, your database username is
`hera`, there is no password associated with that user, and that you have two
separate databases named `hera_mc` and `hera_mc_test` for "production"
deployment and testing. You must have a database named "testing", in "testing"
mode, for the M&C test suite to work.


### Basic OS X PostgreSQL installation notes

Based on our experience getting Dave up and running.

$ brew services start postgresql
==> Successfully started `postgresql` (label: homebrew.mxcl.postgresql)
$ createuser hera
$ createdb -Ohera -Eutf8 hera_mc
$ createdb -Ohera -Eutf8 hera_mc_test
$ psql -U hera hera_mc
```

If you get "socket not found" on createuser your install did not work. Possible solution:

```
$ cd /usr/local/var/postgres/
$ chmod 700 . # make sure the permissions are correct
$ ls -lad . # double check that you (not root) are owner of /usr/local/var/postgres/
$ sudo chown -R <yourusername>:admin /usr/local/var/postgres/ # fix if necessary
$ rm *  # get rid of broken files
$ initdb -D .  # remake the database files
```
